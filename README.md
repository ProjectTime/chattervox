# Chattervox

![Travis CI Build Image](https://travis-ci.com/brannondorsey/chattervox.svg?branch=master)

An AX.25 packet radio chat protocol with support for digital signatures and binary compression. Like IRC over radio waves ðŸ“¡.

Chattervox implements a minimal [packet radio protocol](#the-protocol) on top of AX.25 that can be used with a terminal node controller (TNC) like [Direwolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf) to transmit and receive digitally signed messages using audio frequency shift keying modulation (AFSK). In the United States, it's illegal to broadcast encrypted messages on amateur radio frequencies. Chattervox respects this law, while using elliptic curve cryptography and digital signatures to protect against message spoofing.

With amateur packet radio anyone can pretend to be anyone else. With Chattervox, you can be sure you're chatting with the person you intend to. For more information, check out the [FAQ](FAQ.md).

## Prerequisites

Chattervox requires a linux computer and a serial connection to a TNC to send and receive AX.25 packets. I recommend using [Direwolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf), a popular software TNC which can be run on the same computer hosting the `chattervox` application.

You'll also need a radio and a cable to connect the microphone and speaker from the radio to your linux machine. I recommend the following equipment, especially if you're on a budget:

- $24 Baofeng UV-5R 4-watt radio. This is the absolute best radio you can buy for that price.
- $18 [BTech APRS cable](https://www.amazon.com/BTECH-APRS-K1-Interface-APRSDroid-Compatible/dp/B01LMIBAZW&keywords=btech+aprs+cable) (3.5mm TRRS to 3.5mm and 2.5mm audio cable)

You can also make the cable yourself if you prefer. Check out [this zine](https://books.vvvvvvaria.org/read/41/pdf) for instructions. 

Finally, to operate legally on amateur radio frequencies, you'll need an amateur radio license.

## Download

Binary downloads are available for Linux x64 and x86 architectures on the [releases page](https://github.com/brannondorsey/chattervox/releases).

If you have `npm`, that is the preferred method of install as it allows for the easiest upgrade to the latest version. If you prefer to "build" it from Typescript source and run it as a Node.js app, you can do that as well.

### NPM 

```bash
npm install --cli -g chattervox@latest 
```

### Source

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/brannondorsey/chattervox
cd chattervox

# download dependencies
npm install

# transpile the src/*.ts typescript files to build/*.js
npm run build

# run chattervox from source to opening the chat room
node build/main.js chat
```

## Usage

```bash
# open the chat room
chattervox chat

# generate a new public/private key pair, and use it as your default signing key
chattervox genkey --make-signing

# add a friend's public key to your keyring, so that chattervox can verify their messages
chattervox addkey KC3LZO 0489a1d94d700d6e45508d12a4eb9be93386b5b30feb2b4aa07836398781e3d444e04b54a6e01cf752e54ef423770c00a6

# remove a friend's public key if it has become compromised 
chattervox removekey KC3LZO 0489a1d94d700d6e45508d12a4eb9be93386b5b30feb2b4aa07836398781e3d444e04b54a6e01cf752e54ef423770c00a6

# print all keys in your keyring
chattervox showkey
```

```
usage: chattervox [-h] [-v] [--config CONFIG]
                  {chat,showkey,addkey,removekey,genkey} ...

An AX.25 HAM radio chat protocol with support for digital signatures
and binary compression.

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -v, --version         Show program's version number and exit.
  --config CONFIG, -c CONFIG
                        Path to config file (default: ~/.chattervox/config.json)

subcommands:
  {chat,showkey,addkey,removekey,genkey}
```

## The Protocol

The chattervox packet is primitive and straightforward. It contains a simple header, an optional ECDSA digital signature, and a message payload that can be in plaintext or compressed. As of packet version 1, the protocol is connectionless. There is only one type of packet and there is no mechanism for delivery confirmation (think of it like UDP). It is expected to be transported via AX.25 Unnumbered Information (UI) packets, which the chattervox program relies on for sender and recipient information, as no such fields exists in the packet itself to conserve space.

The protocol may be amended in the future to add new features, however, its simplicity should not be seen as a weakness. The goal of chattervox is singular: **Add cryptographic verifiability to text-based radio communication.**
