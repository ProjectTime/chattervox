# Frequently Asked Questions

## What equipment do I need to use this software?

You'll need a linux computer (raspberry pi included), a cheap hand-held radio, and a cable to connect the microphone and speaker from the two devices to one another. I recommend:

- $24 Baofeng UV-5R 4-watt radio. This is the absolute best radio you can buy for that price.
- $18 [BTech APRS cable](https://www.amazon.com/BTECH-APRS-K1-Interface-APRSDroid-Compatible/dp/B01LMIBAZW&keywords=btech+aprs+cable) (3.5mm TRRS to 3.5mm and 2.5mm audio cable)

You can also make the cable yourself if you prefer. Check out [this zine](https://books.vvvvvvaria.org/read/41/pdf) for instructions.

## How far can I communicate with chattervox?

The distance you can communicate depends on the transmission medium you are using. Messages are encoded and decoded using audio, so anything that can produce or receive audio is capable of sending or receiving chattervox messages. The trick is carrying that audio signal a great distance, and for that the solution is radio. VHF (30-300Mhz) and UHF (300Mhz-3Ghz) radio frequencies can carry signals 2-10+ miles depending on your location, antenna, output power, and propagation characteristics. HF frequencies (3-30Mhz) are capable of reaching several thousand miles, or across oceans. Hell, you could tunnel the audio connection over the internet if you really wanted. 

## Is this legal?

Yes! Well, it depends. If you broadcast digital data on the airwaves you have to make sure that you are allowed to do so. The legality general depends on:

- Where you are?
- Who you are?
- What frequencies you are using?
